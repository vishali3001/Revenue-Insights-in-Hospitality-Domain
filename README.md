Revenue-Insights-in-Hospitality-Domain
The AtliQ Hospitality Revenue Analysis project aims to address the decline in market share and revenue faced by AtliQ Grands, a well-known hospitality company with multiple five-star hotels in India. A 3rd party service provider will be hired to provide insights from the company's historical data and to help regain market share and revenue.

Key Responsibilities:

• Data Gathering: The input data consists of 5 CSV files (dim_date, dim_hotels, dim_rooms, fact_aggregated_bookings, fact_bookings) and a meta information file (meta_data_hospitality.txt) containing information about the columns.

• Key Metrics: The project will focus on analyzing the following key metrics: RevPar (Revenue per Available Room), Occupancy, DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Night), Revenue, ADR (Average Daily Rate), URN (Utilized Room Nights), and BRN (Booked Room Nights). These metrics will help the company understand its revenue realization percentage, identify any channel-level issues, and make informed decisions for future planning.

• Solution Design: A dashboard will be created to display the analyzed data and insights. The dashboard will also include a channel-level split to help identify any channel-level issues.

• Important Jargons: The hospitality industry operates based on weekends (Friday and Saturday) and weekdays (Sunday to Thursday). URN is the number of rooms utilized by customers, while BRN includes utilized rooms, cancellations, and no-shows. RevPar is calculated as Total Revenue divided by Total Rooms Available to sell, while Occupancy is calculated as Total Rooms Occupied divided by Total Rooms Available. ADR is the average rate at which rooms are sold, calculated as Total Rooms Revenue divided by Number of Rooms sold.
